## Food voter app

This app aims to solve food controversial topics by allowing users to create voting ballots regarding controversial topics on food.
Each ballot has title and description, setting ground for a topic that can be either accepted or rejected. For instance, "Does üçç pineapple belong in üçï pizza?".
Users can create as many ballots as they wish (assuming they have the funds to do so), but only one vote is allowed to be cast per user. Votes can be either "accept" or "reject".
After 7 days, the ballot is closed, and we have final results.

# Before running

1. Make sure to have [MetaMask Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) extension installed in your browser.


# Test Setup

1. In your browser, make sure to select **Polygon Amoy Testnet** in your `MetaMask` wallet, by clicking at `MetaMask` icon, then click at the top left to chose network, and insert:

**Name**: Polygon Amoy Testnet
**New RPC URL**: https://rpc-amoy.polygon.technology/
**Chain ID**: 80002
**Currency symbol**: MATIC
**Block Explorer URL**: https://amoy.polygonscan.com/
then save.

2. In order to create ballots and cast votes, make sure to have funds in your wallet. Funds can be easily and freely obtrained via [this faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/). Make sure, in that page, to select `Polygon PoS (Amoy)` network, and to provide your wallet correct address in `Wallet Address` field.

# Running test

1. Go to the root folder and run: 
```shell
$ npm run prod
``` 

2. Connect to the [App](http://localhost:5173).

3. Connect your `MetaMask` wallet in order to create ballots and cast votes.


# Local Setup

1. Install [Foundry Suite](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) and [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).
2. Change directory to ```forge`` directory and start local Anvil node (keep this terminal running);
```shell
$ cd forge;
$ anvil
```
Store any private key provided by Anvil.

# Running locally

1. In another terminal, but same folder, add a .env file according to `.env_template`, and set the stored `private key`.

2. In the same folder, in order to deploy `BallotsManager` contract via:

```shell
$ forge script TestDeployBallotsManagerScript --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545  --broadcast;
```

Store deployed contract address.

3. Now, back to root directory, create a `.env.development` file following `.env_template` template, providing as an env var the address from contract deployed in step above.

4. Start a local instance of React by running `npm run local`. Don't forget to run `npm install` to install dependencies.

5. In app tab, connect to Local RPC Anvil node using Metamask, by clicking at Metamask icon, then click at the top left to chose network, and insert:

**Name**: Anvil local node
**New RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545
**Chain ID**: 31337

6. Connect to the [App](http://localhost:5173) and start creating ballots and casting votes.

7. Connect your `MetaMask` wallet in order to create ballots and cast votes.
# Running tests suite

1. At `forge` directory, simply run

$ forge test 
```

# To be Implemented
- Pagination for User's Contracts;
- Verification when a new Ballot is created;
- Callback for updating Ballot State when Ballot finishes.
